			<h2 class="title text-center">We believe that<br> small can be big</h2>
			<p class="description text-center">Sparkinity was born because we believe in innovation.<br> Data shows that small stores are better positioned than ever to take on retail<br> giants as consumers  increasingly seek curation and a personalised touch.<br> Agility is a powerful weapon and we seek to empower the agile.</p>
			<p class="description text-center">But to fulfil our vision we need to disrupt the age old system of distribution &<br> wholesale. Our founding team has personal experiences & understanding of<br> the  expenses incurred , time and incredible effort that both buyers  & makers<br> make  to connect. All because of the need to get a physical glimpse of that<br> unicorn called the bestseller before risking an order.</p>
			<p class="description text-center">We are changing  the buying process by providing retailers a medium to<br> order online with free returns. Makers save on huge upfront costs for<br> creating distribution networks  &  store owners can easily let their customers<br> decide without taking on the risks involved with buying decisions.</p>
